node 0 result : "t":44, //real is 46 : 5 seconds to 90 seconds means 85 seconds of sending at 1 every 2 seconds -> 43 or so, then 1 to check node1 down, one for node2, one for node 3 = 46 -- suddently its 50 ?

I think some traffic goes via node2 and node3 but im not sure
-- removed the aodv expectation, whatever. and its messing with test results.
it was like this, but the real were different. some nodes were re-initiating route requests because they ignored some replies ?
