-- expect this test to break in future when the retrans issue gets done

-- changed from 9166 to 12 also, as that is when it converges. -- //this is way too random, but 317 is at least what it is for test runs... should be close to at least 320 --- 13 + 1 + 287 * 32 for retrans

-- 08/05 : 0 will also be in learning by the end of this when small stream learning is added

-- 12 / 05 : changed values of learning pkts at node0  from 12 -> 10, means there are 2 more traffic packets -> 39
