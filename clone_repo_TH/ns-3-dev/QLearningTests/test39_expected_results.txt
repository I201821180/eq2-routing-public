  "node0":{
    "t":5422 // first it was t:183, because no reason to stop txing but now suddenly all retransmissions do count ? or is it just this type of traffic? anyway, then its 14 pakcets as normal, 15th dropped due to crash, then 169*32 times retrans and we drop the ICMP time exceeded shit

  "node1":{
    "broken":n,
  },
  "node2":{
    "broken":y,
  },
  "node3":{
    "broken":n,
  },
}

In the script runs, node2 is chosen to route the 1763 next icmps, but in the tests it is node1 so we have to flip the values
