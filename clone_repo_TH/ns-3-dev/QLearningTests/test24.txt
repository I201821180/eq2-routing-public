Somehow! if we swap the positions of test23 and test24, test23 won't work because node3 does not see any RREP Hello messages or anything
this is quite a big issue, but I feel like it's not something we can account for? I mean clearly its the RNG affecting the RREPs?
I dont know! --> TODO possibly been fixed along with the issue in test54
