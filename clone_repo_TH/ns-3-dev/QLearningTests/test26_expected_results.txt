    "t":0,
  },
  "node2":{
    "q":0,
    "a":5, //RREP hello, rrep to 10.1.1.1 for route to 10.1.1.4, RREQ for route to 10.1.1.1 (why? TODO -- forwarding) -- RREQ 2x --- then RREP after that is sent back to 10.1.1.4 (node3) via node2
    "t":0,
  },
  "node3":{
    "q":0, // for traffic it's 2, then one reply to RREP from 10.1.1.3 to get to 10.1.1.1
    "a":4, // Hello, then three RREQ's with increasing TTL

  },
}

In the script runs, node2 is chosen to route the 1763 next icmps, but in the tests it is node1 so we have to flip the values
