{
  "NameDesc":copy of test95 with less nodes - trying to debug the issue im seeing where it doesnt learn the correct route if delay is nonzero - LATEST ISSUE : EPS 0 meant no learning traffic after end of lrn / start of traffic,
  "Number of nodes":3,
  "trafficType":voip/trafficB,
  "totalTime":400,
  "eps":0.25, -empirically shown that this is high enough to match our expected lrn packets
  "learning_rate":0.5,
  "ideal":false,
  "maxpackets":677,
  "learning_phases":true,
  "smaller_learning_traffic":true,
  "node0":{
    "x":0,
    "y":20,
  },
  "node1":{
    "x":110,
    "y":20,
    "slower":l3,
    "delay_value":0,
  },
  "node2":{
    "x":220,
    "y":20,
  },
}

-- a lot of learning traffic because smaller learning traffic is true, and voip traffic is from itself a very large stream of data
-- so thats why the big difference. test results were fine all along
