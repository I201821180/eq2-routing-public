{
  "NameDesc":voip/trafficB traffic in some sort of star shape testing learning phases in no-QoS environment - copy of test81 and somehow different results showing impact of rng,

so in this test i noticed the issue with queue time influencing too much the travel time, & need tod os etomhing about it
