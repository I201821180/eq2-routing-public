{
  "node0":{
    "q":1767, //Two RREP -> both get Q'd also 2 ICMP reply
    "a":5,
    "t":1765,
  },
  "node1":{
    "q":100, 
    "a":3, //RREP hello, rrep to 10.1.1.4 for route to 10.1.1.1, RREQ for route to 10.1.1.1 (why? TODO)
    "t":0,
  },
  "node2":{
    "q":100,
    "a":4, //RREP hello, rrep to 10.1.1.4 for route to 10.1.1.1, RREQ for route to 10.1.1.1 (why? TODO) -- possibly forwarded from node3 ?? --- then RREP after that is sent back to 10.1.1.4 (node3)
    "t":0,
  },
  "node3":{
    "q":1766, // for traffic it's 2, then one reply to RREP from 10.1.1.3 to get to 10.1.1.1
    "a":3, // Hello, then two RREQ's with increasing TTL
    "t":1765,
  },
}

In the script runs, node2 is chosen to route the 1763 next icmps, but in the tests it is node1 so we have to flip the values
