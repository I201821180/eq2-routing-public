I guess put anything here, cant matter too much as long as its after the 4 nodes
so 120 distance on the X-axis seems to be too far, and makes for a spotty connection (only some packets arrive)
good to know...

-- strange, in this case, after the 2 pings (only 2 seconds of sending time for the dataGen) are done, the route learns a route with a loop in it
-- but this happens after the 2 pings, first ping is looped a bit between 3 and 2, but then reaches 4 perfectly
-- while the 2nd packet goes the correct route
-- IF THERE WAS A 3rd packet, it would go wrong, but it doesnt so i guess leave as is ?
