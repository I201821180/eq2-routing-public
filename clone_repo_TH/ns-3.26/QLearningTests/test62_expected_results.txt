node 0 result : "t":44, //real is 46 : 5 seconds to 90 seconds means 85 seconds of sending at 1 every 2 seconds -> 43 or so, then 1 to check node1 down, one for node2, one for node 3 = 46 -- suddently its 50 ?

I think some traffic goes via node2 and node3 but im not sure


12/05 - issue found, there are 43 packets being sent
  -> two wrong decisions for pkt 1 causing 2 extra transmissions -> +45
  -> nr 13 is being ignored for some reason -> -1
  -> finding three nodes not available -> +3
  = 47
  but we want to see 50 ? or 48

  its udp-no-echo so thats one packet then 2 seconds of nothing
  start  at t = 7; continue until t = 30 / 60 / 90
  t = 90 i guess
  so 5,7, 9,
  11, 13, 15, 17, 19
  2
  3
  4
  5
  6
  7
  8
  thus 43 pkt can possibly be sent in the time

  add 2 mistakes on pkt seq 1 -> we get 45 pkts
  add that we will always have 3 packets that are dropped, but we count them anyway -> 48 pkts
  BUT these packets may fall in the first 45 pkts, and they are not retransmitted (TODO this is also in thomasAODV, try retransmitting it via another neighbour immediately instead of dropping it? or add that as future )
  SO there will be between 45 and 48 transmissions ?


-- suddenly extra errors after fixing the pkt queue time -> 47 (it was 49 so its in margin)
