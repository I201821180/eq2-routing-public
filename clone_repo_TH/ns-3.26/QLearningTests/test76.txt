// so this issue came up in QlrnTests.cc runs only, was able to fix
// At first, this if-else loop would react to qlrnHeader.GetPDst being converged, but this would cause issues when AODV traffic that was being used to learn was messing with convergences
// thus, we had to replace the HasConverged(qlrnHeader.GetPDst() ) by HasConverged(m_traffic_destination)  -- TODO is there a better way here?
