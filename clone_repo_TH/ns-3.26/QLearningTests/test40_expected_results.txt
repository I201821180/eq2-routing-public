  "qroute":0,
  "node0":{
    "t":14, //TODO actually expected this to be 13, packets are counted that are never actually sent. Apparently #14 is the one then where down is noticed, but it is counted as traffic all the same. Perhaps a rework of the traffic counting system is in order.

    "broken":y,
  },
  "node2":{
    "broken":n,
  },
  "node3":{

}

In the script runs, node2 is chosen to route the 1763 next icmps, but in the tests it is node1 so we have to flip the values
